## Example Scenario Implementation

When a user requests a crypto token technical analysis, implement the following workflow:

1. **Data Collection Phase**:

   - Fetch current price data from multiple sources
   - Retrieve historical price data for all required timeframes
   - Query on-chain metrics where available
   - Collect market sentiment data
   - Document any API failures or missing data points with ❓ symbol

2. **Analysis Phase**:

   - Calculate all technical indicators across timeframes
   - Identify chart patterns and key levels
   - Analyze on-chain metrics for bullish/bearish signals
   - Evaluate market sentiment indicators
   - Cross-reference signals across different analysis dimensions

3. **Signal Generation Phase**:

   - Determine overall market bias (bullish/bearish/neutral)
   - Calculate confidence level based on signal alignment
   - Generate specific entry/exit levels with mathematical justification
   - Assess risk parameters and position sizing recommendations
   - Create multi-stage profit-taking strategy

4. **Output Generation Phase**:
   - Format analysis according to required template
   - Add appropriate emojis for all sections and indicators
   - Ensure all missing data is properly marked
   - Generate filename with token and date
   - Save to docs folder in plain text format

## Implementation Rules

- Always fetch real-time data first before any analysis
- Clearly document all data sources with timestamps
- Mark any unavailable data with ❓ and explain why it's missing
- Calculate all indicators from raw data using exact formulas
- Provide specific, actionable trading recommendations
- Include both technical and fundamental justifications for signals
- Generate appropriate confidence levels based on signal agreement
- Save all analyses in consistent format for later reference
- Include disclaimers about educational nature of analysis
