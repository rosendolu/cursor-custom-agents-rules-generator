# List Applied Rules

## Critical Rules

- At the end of EVERY response, list all rules that were applied during the request processing
- Format the list as a collapsible section titled "Applied Rules 📜"
- Include the rule name, type (auto/manual/always/agent), and a brief one-line description of how it was used
- If no rules were applied, still show the section with "No rules were applied in this request"
- Order rules by their importance and application order
- Use consistent emoji indicators for different rule types:
  - 🔄 Auto Rules
  - 👤 Manual Rules
  - ⭐ Always Rules
  - 🤖 Agent Rules

## Examples
